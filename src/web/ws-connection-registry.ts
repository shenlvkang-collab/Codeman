/**
 * @fileoverview Per-session WebSocket connection registry (COD-137).
 *
 * Replaces the bare `Map<sessionId, number>` counter that previously gated
 * `MAX_WS_PER_SESSION`. That counter had two defects:
 *
 *   1. Transient over-count on reconnect: a client that drops and immediately
 *      reconnects could land its new upgrade BEFORE the old socket's async
 *      `close` fired, so the count briefly exceeded the live connection number.
 *      A reconnect burst could hit the cap and the next upgrade was rejected
 *      with 4008 → the client fell back to HTTP. (The real spurious-4008 defect.)
 *   2. No clientId scoping: the limit counted raw sockets, so a reconnecting
 *      client consumed a NEW slot instead of replacing its own.
 *
 * This registry tracks the live socket(s) per session keyed by a per-TAB
 * connection identity (`cid`, parsed from the upgrade URL query). The browser
 * sends `clientId:tabNonce`, NOT the bare localStorage clientId — that one is
 * shared by every tab/window of a profile, so keying on it would make two tabs
 * on one session evict each other in a 4010 ping-pong. A new upgrade for a
 * `cid` that already holds a socket is a SUPERSEDE — the registry evicts the
 * stale socket and reuses its slot, which makes a reconnect reclaim rather
 * than double-count (fixes #1 and #2). The cid is opaque here; input-frame
 * dedup uses the bare clientId separately (`session.shouldApplyInput`).
 *
 * Backward-compat: an upgrade with NO `cid` (legacy clients, other tools) is
 * admitted anonymously — it counts toward the limit but never evicts another
 * client, and several anonymous sockets can coexist up to the cap.
 *
 * The class is pure (no `ws`/Fastify imports) and generic over a minimal socket
 * shape so it can be unit-tested with plain fakes. The route owns the actual
 * socket close/terminate; the registry only decides admit/evict and tracks slots.
